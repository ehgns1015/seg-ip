# IP Management System

## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Development Workflow ðŸš¨

**NEVER make changes directly to the `main` branch!**

Always follow these steps when making changes:
1. Create a new branch with a descriptive name related to your changes (e.g., `feature/add-unit-validation`, `bugfix/fix-ip-duplicate-check`)
2. Make your changes in this branch
3. Test your changes thoroughly
4. Create a pull request to merge your branch into `main`
5. Wait for review and approval before merging

Failure to follow this workflow may result in code conflicts, lost work, or application instability.

## Project Overview

This IP Management System is designed to track and manage IP addresses, computer units (both employee machines and other networked devices), and inventory items across multiple locations. It provides a comprehensive solution for tracking technology assets and supplies.

## Features

### IP Management
- View all available IP addresses in the network
- Create and manage units (employees and machines) with their respective IP addresses
- Validate IP addresses to prevent duplicates
- Support for shared computers with primary user tracking
- Detailed unit information tracking

### Inventory Management
- Track inventory items across multiple locations (Wiley, Redding, Jane)
- Monitor item quantities and status
- End-of-stock (EOS) indicators
- Item history with timestamps
- Notes and additional information for each item

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: Not implemented (consider adding)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- MongoDB instance
- npm or yarn

   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:

```
MONGODB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
DB_NAME=your_database_name

# Employee fields configuration - JSON array of field configurations
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMPLOYEE_FIELDS=[{"name":"name","type":"text"},{"name":"ip","type":"text"},{"name":"department","type":"text"},{"name":"MAC","type":"text"},{"name":"email","type":"text"},{"name":"sharedComputer","type":"checkbox"},{"name":"primaryUser","type":"select"},{"name":"note","type":"textarea"}]

# Machine fields configuration - JSON array of field configurations
NEXT_PUBLIC_MACHINE_FIELDS=[{"name":"name","type":"text"},{"name":"ip","type":"text"},{"name":"line","type":"text"},{"name":"device","type":"text"},{"name":"MAC","type":"text"},{"name":"username","type":"text"},{"name":"pw","type":"text"},{"name":"note","type":"textarea"}]

# Gateways configuration - JSON array of gateway objects with IP and range
NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAYS=[{"ip":"192.168.1.1","range":254},{"ip":"192.168.2.1","range":254}]
```
